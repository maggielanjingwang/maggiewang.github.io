Something about myself
* I have a passion for cooking, approaching it like a data science experiment. Every New Year, I host a gathering at home, preparing a variety of Chinese dishes for my friends. Based on their overwhelmingly positive feedback, Iâ€™d confidently conclude that my cooking skills are statistically significant in delivering excellent results!

* I am passionate about exploring new horizons and challenging myself with diverse experiences. In 2024, I began learning to fly the Cessna 172, marking an exciting chapter in my journey. This summer, I successfully passed the written exam for my Private Pilot License (PPL), and I continue to dedicate my leisure time to mastering the art of flight.
